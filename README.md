## General info
The purpose of this project is to develop an algorithm that can predict whether or not a patient will develop cervical cancer according to their behavioral practices. In order to execute this, the dataset entitled “Cervical Cancer Behavior Risk Data Sheet” from the UCI website was used to train and test the algorithm. A Random Forest Classifier was used to develop an accurate decision tree and determine the most important features. This algorithm can be used by physicians to determine whether or not a patient is at risk for developing cervical cancer and to provide advice on lifestyle changes that could mitigate the risk of developing cervical cancer.
